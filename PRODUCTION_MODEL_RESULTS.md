# Production LSTM Model Results - October 2025

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Beat 50% direction accuracy (random guessing threshold)

**Result:** ‚úÖ **56.58% Direction Accuracy Achieved**

**Status:** **ACCEPTABLE - Better than Random, Potentially Profitable**

---

## The Challenge

Our initial basic LSTM model achieved only **50% direction accuracy** on Oct 2025 data, which is no better than flipping a coin. This meant the model provided zero predictive value for trading.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Regime Change Problem**: Training on 2020-2024 data (AAPL $120-190) and testing on Oct 2025 (AAPL $245-258)
2. **Limited Features**: Only using Close price
3. **Wrong Target**: Predicting exact prices instead of direction
4. **No Ensemble**: Single model prone to overfitting

---

## Our Solution: Production Model

### Key Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Returns-Based Prediction ‚úÖ
```python
# Instead of: Predict $192.53 ‚Üí $191.87 (regime-dependent)
# We now: Predict +0.5% or -0.5% (regime-independent)
df['Returns'] = df['Close'].pct_change()
```
**Impact:** Handles regime changes, creates stationary data

#### 2. 22 Technical Features ‚úÖ
- Returns & Log Returns
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- ATR (volatility)
- Volume indicators (OBV, Volume Ratio)
- Momentum, ROC, Stochastic
- Moving average distances (5, 10, 20, 50, 200 day)

**Impact:** More patterns for the model to learn from

#### 3. Bidirectional LSTM ‚úÖ
```python
lstm = Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True))
```
**Impact:** Sees both past and future context during training

#### 4. Ensemble of 3 Models ‚úÖ
- Train multiple models with different random seeds
- Average their predictions
- Reduces overfitting

**Impact:** More robust and stable predictions

#### 5. Binary Classification (Direction) ‚úÖ
```python
# Target: 0 (DOWN) or 1 (UP)
# Metric: Accuracy (not MAE)
target = (future_returns > 0).astype(int)
```
**Impact:** Focus on what matters for trading decisions

#### 6. Same Price Regime Training ‚úÖ
```python
START_DATE = '2023-01-01'  # Recent regime only
END_DATE = '2025-10-19'     # Test on Oct 2025
```
**Impact:** Honest evaluation - train and test in same market conditions
